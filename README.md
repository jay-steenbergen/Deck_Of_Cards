# Deck_Of_Cards
This app will create a deck of cards and then shuffle them.
You can create as many players as you want and give them names.
The goal is to deal one card at time to whom ever you want.
Once you have delt all 52 cards you cannot deal anymore.
Currently working on decoupling ShowPlayer class by making and IWriter Interface. 
After decoupling I will move to making the menu more readable.
Last I will write test methods.
